## TDD Requirement
This project uses strict TDD.

Workflow for every change:
1. Write tests first (API, component, unit) for the intended behavior.
2. Run tests and see them fail (red).
3. Implement the change (green).
4. Refactor as needed.

All new tests must be included in CI and run on every push/PR.
